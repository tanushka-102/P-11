•	HTML: (To build the structure) HTML is a crucial component of the World Wide Web and is used by web developers to create dynamic and interactive websites. 


•	CSS: (Used in Styling for Visual Appeal) CSS is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of web pages. It allows web developers to separate the presentation style of a document from its content, defined in HTML.
CSS provides a wide range of styling options, including the ability to set background colors and images, control the size and spacing of elements, and specify the font and color of text. 


•	JavaScript: (Interactivity and Functionality) It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

•	Python: (Backend Development) Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
